I'm a Site Reliability Engineer with a passion for solving complex system design challenges—the kind of problems most people would walk away from, but I thrive on. With years of experience managing distributed services in Kubernetes (AKS), automating cloud infrastructure with Terraform, and ensuring security and observability at scale, I focus on building resilient, self-healing systems that just work.

I’ve spent most of my life in the Pacific Northwest, where I developed a deep appreciation for both technology and problem-solving. From managing enterprise-scale infrastructure migrations to fine-tuning zero-downtime deployments with blue/green and canary strategies, I enjoy tackling challenges that push the boundaries of automation and reliability.

Beyond work, I’m a dedicated father of two boys, always looking for ways to share my curiosity and problem-solving mindset with them. Whether it’s optimizing cloud deployments, mentoring junior engineers, or fixing whatever’s broken around the house, I bring the same drive to every challenge—if there’s a problem, I’ll find a way to solve it.
