Functional Requirements
Infrastructure Provisioning: Automate the creation of an Azure account, including resource groups, networking, identity management, and security configurations using Terraform.
State Management: Store Terraform state securely using Terraform Enterprise’s PostgreSQL backend and Azure Storage Accounts, ensuring no customer state is co-located.
Encryption: Enable encryption at rest for all storage accounts and PostgreSQL databases using Azure-managed keys or customer-managed keys (CMK).
Identity and Access Management (IAM): Configure Azure Active Directory (AAD) roles and permissions to enforce least privilege access for Terraform workflows.
Logging and Monitoring: Enable Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Terraform Enterprise audit logs for tracking infrastructure changes and access patterns.
Networking Security: Restrict Terraform state storage and PostgreSQL database access using private endpoints, service endpoints, and network security groups (NSGs).
Secrets Management: Store sensitive credentials (e.g., service principal secrets) securely in Azure Key Vault and retrieve them dynamically within Terraform workflows.
Deployment Workflow: Implement CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps) to validate and apply Terraform configurations in a structured and automated manner.
Non-Functional Requirements
Security & Compliance:

Ensure end-to-end encryption for all data at rest and in transit.
Enforce RBAC policies to prevent unauthorized access.
Implement audit logging for compliance with industry standards (e.g., HIPAA, SOC2).
Scalability:

Support multi-tenant environments without co-locating customer state in shared storage.
Allow dynamic scaling of Terraform Enterprise’s PostgreSQL database and storage backend.
Reliability & Availability:

Design for high availability, ensuring zero downtime for state storage and Terraform Enterprise.
Implement backup and disaster recovery for PostgreSQL and storage accounts.
Performance:

Optimize Terraform runs to complete within defined SLAs.
Minimize API rate limits and latency issues with Azure resource provisioning.
Maintainability:

Use modular Terraform configurations to enable reusability and ease of updates.
Implement automated testing and validation for Terraform modules before deployment.
Cost Optimization:

Use reserved instances or autoscaling where applicable to reduce cloud costs.
Monitor Terraform execution costs and storage utilization with Azure Cost Management.
